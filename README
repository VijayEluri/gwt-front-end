Welcome to the AndWellness Frontend code!  


BACKGROUND:

The majority of this code is written in Java and compiled to
JavaScript using the included GWT libraries.  To compile the code,
make sure java and javac are installed and run ant build.  The
compiled code will be placed into war/andwellnessvisualizations.  The
.js file and every cache file must be copied into the AndWellness
Server codebase into the web/js/gwt subdirectory.  A simple script is
included.  Feel free to run: scripts/deploy_gwt.sh <andwellness server
base dir> to automatically copy the files.  Once the files are in the
andwellness server codebase, change to the andwellness server base
directory and run 'ant clean dist'.  The GWT files will be zipped into
a deployable war file.


COLLABORATION POLICY:

Please avoid pushing to master. Instead, please push to a development branch.


CODING STANDARDS:

4 space indents (no tabs)

Always use curly braces even if the conditional or loop is one line

Opening curly braces go on the same line of the loop or conditional declaration

Comments anywhere can only be 80 chars per line

For code, most of us have been going with 80 chars per line, but that is not a hard and fast rule.
